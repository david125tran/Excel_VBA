# Excel_VBA
Here are some of my VBA projects to showcase some of my VBA programming.  Let me upload some GIFs to make this repository more fun!  
  
### RockPaperScissors.xlsm  
A mock example of the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors using VBA to demonstrate proper VBA syntax, macros, and buttons.

### BMI.xlsm  
A spreadsheet that takes in information of a person to calculate their BMI and push it to a different sheet.  Here I showcase creating a function, calling a function, case statements, if else statements, looping through rows, creating macros, creating buttons, and copying rows of data to the end of a list in a different sheet.
